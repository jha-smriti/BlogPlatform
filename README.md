# Bloggify

Bloggify is a full-stack blogging platform where users can create, edit, delete, and interact with blog posts. Users can like, comment, and share posts, with real-time notifications to keep them updated. The platform uses React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. Caching with `node-cache` optimizes performance for fetching latest blogs and user data.
